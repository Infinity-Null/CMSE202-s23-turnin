#Here is the data that everyone worked to obtain:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
#Group 1: compiled data, now they are divided into even and odd arrays.
x=np.array([1,3,5,7,9])
y=np.array([2,4,6,8,10])
Create branch 2
#Group 2: multiplied all odd values by 3 and all even values by 5.
x1=3*x
y1=5*y
branch merge

Create branch 3
#Group 3: plotted the data as an x,y graph.
plt.plot(x1,y1)
branch merge

#Everyone check for typos
